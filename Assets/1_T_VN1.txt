I… 
I can’t breathe.

[THOUGHT]
The waves, the current, the darkness. They’re surrounding me, enveloping me whole till all my senses are dulled. 


I can hear the thunder cracking in the distance. The waves crash on top of me, sending me spiraling underneath the surface.


I paddle my way back to the top, only to be pushed back down into the depths.


I’m powerless to the elements. I’m thrown around like a doll, unable to find any sort of respite in the assault.


I’m falling. I’m sinking. I kick as hard as I possibly can, clawing at the water around me, desperately trying to remain on the surface. 


My limbs feel raw from my flailing, but I keep resisting. The waves are grabbing hold of me, dragging me under to the black beneath me.


I can’t fight back. I’m sinking. I can’t breathe. I gulp for air only to engulf the ocean into my lungs. 


I choke and gag, vomiting out fluid. I can’t think anymore. It hurts. I’m scared. 


I’m…

[THOUGHT]
Hah…


I scan around me in a fit, looking to see where I am.


My bedroom. Messy as always.


It’s just a dream.


I shut off the alarm, and pry myself out of the bed. 


I’m not exactly well-rested after what I just slept through, but I don’t have the luxury of time to doze back off and make up for it.


For once, I’ve got places to be today.


I put on the uniform I laid out yesterday night. It’s snug, but comfortable enough to move around in.


Time to get going.

[THOUGHT]
Bleeding from a wound can usually be stopped by applying a sterile dressing…


Infection is very likely to take place if a wound touches the ground, or if anything else unsanitary touches or gets into it…


Turning page after page, I find myself immersed in my textbook, attempting to absorb every detail as if it’s the last time I’ll see it. 


Dammit, Eric. This isn’t like you to cram last minute.


I fall into a trance, lost in the sea of words in front of me and gently rocked by the motions and rumbles of the streetcar.


It’s almost meditative. Despite being surrounded by the machinations of the city around me, I’m in my own world. My own personal bubble.


That is until I’m thrown back to reality by a tap on my shoulder.


[Man]
What are you reading there, pal?




[THOUGHT]
Oh no. Small talk with strangers.


Stay calm. Judging by his tone, the man sounds like a respectable person. But, I’m really not in the mood for banter.


I try not to make eye contact. That usually gives them the hint that I’m not interested.


But I still need to respond. Dammit. What to say, what to say…


Just tell the truth?


[Eric]
Uh… a book.


[THOUGHT]
A…


A book?


What kind of answer is that?


Christ, pull yourself together for once.


[Man]
Haha, right.


Guess I meant to ask you what you’re reading about.


[THOUGHT]
I bet he’s already regretting starting a conversation with me.


I don’t blame him.


[Eric]
Er… well… first aid… and all that.


It’s nothing relatively interesting.


[Man]
Well, interesting thing for a kid to be reading. You going in the CDD or something?


[THOUGHT]
Please. Go away.


[Eric]
Yes. I’m studying for the practical exam.


[THOUGHT]
The man gives a thunderous whistle, seemingly impressed.


[Man]
Talking to a real smartie-pants, aren’t I? 


You youngsters are the real deal nowadays, especially during these times. I’ll leave you to study, pal.


[THOUGHT]
He gives me a hefty pat on the shoulder, and shuffles away. My eyes are still glued to the text book.


He was nice enough, considering. But finally, I have some space and quiet.


I start to finish the section I left off on-


[Streetcar Conductor]
Next stop, Civilian Defense Department! 


[THOUGHT]
Perfect. Wonderful. I’m done for.

[THOUGHT]
Holding the textbook tight between my arms, I step into the lecture room. 


With tables and desks neatly aligned into uniform rows, it’s quite spacious having been converted from an old government building.


Letting go of the breath I didn’t realize I was holding, I scan the room and search for an empty seat.


There, in the corner. An unoccupied desk in the back. It’s perfect.


Walking over, trying to avoid the notice of anyone else in the room, I pull out the old chair.


It’s an old, rickety thing. It seems barely capable of holding its own weight, much less me.


[SFX]5

I sit myself down, ignoring the ear wrenching squeal that comes from the chair.


It doesn’t immediately collapse. Good.


I’m a few minutes early. Taking advantage of the few moments I have to myself, I flip open the textbook and start cramming.


Where was I… tourniquet applications, that’s right.


To stop profuse bleeding in a limb laceration, place a tourniquet proximal to the-


[Girl]
Ah, gosh, just barely made it!


[SFX]5


[THOUGHT]
A girl noisily plops down on the desk right next to me.


I… quite literally chose the most isolated seat in the room. Why is this happening?


I keep my eyes glued to the book, trying to avoid eye contact. Maybe she won’t initiate anything if I just…


[Girl]
Oh, hey there! Are you ready for the test?


[THOUGHT]
This strategy never works.


[Eric]
Uh… I guess.


[Girl]
That’s better than me, at least. I feel so unprepared! 


I spent all last night staying up and reading through all the chapters again. Barely got a wink of sleep! 


I don’t know, I know I studied everything as much as I could, but I still don’t feel ready.


[THOUGHT]
Oh dear lord, she’s a chatterbox.


[Eric]
I’m sure you did the best you could.


[Girl]
Ah… maybe? I feel like I still could been more ready. But I guess that’s all moot now, just gotta try my best now. 


Where are you from, by the way?


[Eric]
Local. I take the streetcar everyday here.


[Girl]
Ooo, that’s great! I’m not from around here, so I’m just dorming in the CDD barracks for now. 


[Eric]
Ah, I see.


[Girl]
Yup! It’s a new experience, but I think I’m getting along pretty well here.


Oh, is that our textbook you’re reading?


[Eric]
Yeah. I’ve been trying to cram some of the material.


…


I… should… uhh… really get back to studying now.


[Girl]
Oh- Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry! 


I didn’t even think- you must be cramming right now!


I’ll leave you alone, I’m sorry for bothering you.


[Eric]
No, it’s alright.


[THOUGHT]
She withdraws from the conversation, leaving me to my own work.


She’s gone quiet. Peace and space.


I suppose that’s what I wanted… but I don’t feel good about it.


Peeking away from my textbook, I decide to take a quick glance at the girl.


She looks pretty dejected. She’s looking down at her lap, twiddling her fingers. 


I’m far from good at keeping a conversation, but I can usually sense when someone isn’t feeling great.


…


Ah, screw it.


[Eric]
What’s your name?


[Girl]
Huh? Didn’t you have to study? I don’t want to distract you or anything.


[Eric]
No, don’t worry. Five minutes isn’t going to change anything. 


I should have introduced myself earlier, I’m Eric.


[Girl]
Oh shoot, I forgot to tell you mine too. I’m Hannah!


[Eric]
Nice to meet you.


[THOUGHT]
I legitimately can’t remember the last time I introduced myself like that.


Now that I’ve chosen to actually invest myself in a conversation, I begin to pay more attention to the girl in front of me.

[THOUGHT]
The first thing I notice is her ginger hair. She’s a bit shorter than me, but probably has about ten times the energy inside of her.


I can see her bouncing her legs excitedly, as she flashes me a pearly smile.


Looks like she’s cheered right up. That’s good to see.


[Eric]
You… uh… said you weren't from LM, right? 


[Hannah]
Yeah! I moved from up North.


[Eric]
North of the state? That’s a far way out. What brings you to LM?


[Hannah]
Oh! 


Well, uh, I got a… special commission to join the CDD. 


I wanted to do something to help out with the war, so down I came and here I am!


[Eric]
Wow, that’s impressive. Most people usually just talk about the food and the beaches.


[Hannah]
Well, it’s not like that isn’t nice as well, hehe. Honestly, I wish I had more time to explore…


[SFX]5


[THOUGHT]
She gets no further before the sound of heavy footsteps rings through the air. It’s a solid clack, almost like horse hooves on solid concrete.


We both freeze. Out of the corner of my eyes, I see the rest of the class quickly ending their own conversations to scramble to their seats.


 We all know what that noise is.


[SFX]3


The door creaks open, and he walks in.


[???]
Attention!


[THOUGHT]
Without delay, as a single entity, we all stand and salute the Captain. 


[ENTER]2


[THOUGHT]
Captain Stone.


He walks down the row up to the front of the room, commanding authority from the entirety of the class.


He’s a large man, to say the least. His hair has turned a silver gray from age, but that’s not to say he’s frail.


From head to toe, anyone can tell that this man is a pack leader. His eyes glisten and shine with confidence and pride. 


His uniform hides it well, but his body is incredibly well built. It’s clear that he actively keeps himself in good shape, even at his age. At a glance, he can probably pass for those old marble statues at the history museums.


It’s clear he’s on a different level than us. Any man would be chock full of jealousy and envy.


…that’s what the girl who sat next to me on the first day of class said. Ad verbatim.


I promptly moved seats the next day.


The Captain’s voice snaps me out of whatever in the world I was just thinking about.


[Captain]
At ease.


[THOUGHT]
We relax, and return back to our seats. 


Captain Stone stands before us, his hand tucked into his coat.


[Captain]
Ladies and gentlemen, it’s been a long journey. 


You’ve been holed up in this damn room for the past few months, studying and working your asses off.


I promise you, none of your efforts are in vain.


Today’s the day where you show off everything you know. 


This final practical exam will cover everything we’ve drilled during our time together. 


You are well-prepared, and I have full confidence in you.


This is the only moment in your entire career where you will ever hear any superior medical officer give you this order.


Kill it.


Show me the results of your hard work.


[THOUGHT]
The classroom erupts into a thunderous, “Yes sir!”


This is really it. The final stretch to the finish line.


I'm almost done.


Don’t screw up now.


[Captain]
Everyone, one last thing before we begin.


As you all know, cooperation is crucial in medical aid and emergency rescue.


That’s why this exam will be conducted in pairs. You have twenty seconds to find a buddy.


[THOUGHT]
Pair up, no problem.


…


Wait, I’m sorry, WHAT?


[Captain]
Don’t think I don’t see you dawdling over there, Wai. Time starts now.


20…


19…


[THOUGHT]
Guess he knew I was always the quiet type. 


I see everyone around me immediately finding partners to work with.


This isn’t good. I barely talk to anyone here, where am I supposed to-


[Hannah]
Hey, wanna buddy up?


[THOUGHT]
I’m saved.


[Eric]
Y-yeah, sure, I’d love to.


[Hannah]
Awesome! We’re going to smash this test!


…


Uh, I know I said I wasn’t feeling all that ready, but I’ll do my best!


[Eric]
Don’t worry. I’m sure we’ll be fine.


[Captain]
About time. It seems everyone’s all buddied up. Let’s get right into the briefing.

[Captain]
As I mentioned before, this exam will be simulating various different emergency scenarios that you can expect to find yourself in.


Be prepared to use all your skills that were taught to you.


Here’s the situation. You’re walking around downtown, when you see a car in the road swerve and hit the curb.


You rush to the scene to find people pulling the passengers out of the vehicle. It appears that two people have been injured.


From what you can gather from the witnesses, the driver fell unconscious at the wheel. 


They can’t tell you anything more than that- you’ll have to gather information on the spot.


Patient 1 will be a mannequin. Patient 2 will be your partner acting the role.


Wai, you’ll be going first. Show us what you’ve got.


[Eric]
Yes, sir!


[THOUGHT]
First? He’s really on me today.


[Captain]
Grayman, get yourself setup in the backroom and a fresh uniform. We’ll be using mock blood and paint for your injuries.


[Hannah]
Yes, sir!


Good luck, Eric! You got this!


[THOUGHT]
She skips away, leaving the room to get changed. 


Moment of truth.


It’s time to do what I’ve been training to do for all these months. Let’s get this over with.
