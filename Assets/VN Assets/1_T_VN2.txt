[THOUGHT]
At last.


I stand back, exhausted and a bit in a daze.


I wipe the blood- or rather, the red paint, off my hands. 


[Captain]
That was a good show, son. 


[THOUGHT]
He lets a proud smile escape, and gives me a hefty pat on my shoulder.


[Eric]
Did… I pass?


[Captain]
No.


[THOUGHT]
...


What?


Oh my God.


What happened? Did I miss something? I thought I covered everything. Where did I go-


[Captain]
Relax, sonny, I was messing with you. You passed.


[THOUGHT]
I hate you.


[Eric]
Ah… I see… thank you, sir.


[Hannah]
Eric! You did amazing!

[THOUGHT]
She hops up from the ground, dusting herself off and loosening the bandages I tied around her.


[Eric]
Ah… thanks.


[Hannah]
Of course!


…hey, you’re looking a bit tired. You okay?


[Eric]
Yeah, I am feeling a bit exhausted after that. I think I’ll go lay down for a moment.

[THOUGHT]
I start to take my leave, planning to catch my breath and sit down at a desk.


[Captain]
Where do you think you’re going, Wai?


[Eric]
Uh, Sir?


[Captain]
I should flunk you for abandoning your partner. This is a cooperative exam.


 It’s your turn to be the patient. Get your rear in the backroom and get changed.


[Hannah]
You can get your nap later. Have fun~


[THOUGHT]
Dammit.

Hannah finished her practical with me in record time. 


Despite her saying how worried she was, she passed with flying colors. She might have even blown me out of the water.


After our turn, I waited in the back of the room, keeping quiet so as to not disturb the others during their practical. 


Hannah stayed at the front, letting me take my much needed nap.


After what must have been an hour, it was all finished.

[Captain]
That wraps up the last of the practicals. 


[THOUGHT]
The Captain positions himself in the front of the room. 


He clears his throat, and after a small pause, he begins to speak.


[Captain]
Everyone, may I have your attention.

We live in times marked by violence. 


Across the ocean, there are people dying every second to bullets. Bombs. Flames.


Every year this war continues, the more destruction we bring upon ourselves.


The duty of a medical technician is not to fan the flames of war. Rather, we serve to resist this brutality, and save those put in danger’s way. 


Ladies and gentlemen, we do no harm. But we do know harm.


I have seen how hard you have worked these past few months.


I am proud to announce that every person in this room is now a medical technician of the Civilian Defense Department. 


Congratulations. You’ve earned it.


[THOUGHT]
The class stands up, cheering and clapping in a ferocious celebration.


Even I join in. It’s a proud moment.


As the others begin to mingle and socialize with one another, I fumble by myself in the back of the room.


It looks like there’s not much for me to do at this point. I was never one for socializing.


I get up from my seat, quietly trying to leave without making a fuss. Might as well try and get home early, I’m exhausted.


As I reach for the exit, a familiar voice interrupts me.


[Hannah]
Hey, Eric?


[Eric]
Hm?

[Hannah]
I know I said it before back then, but you did great today.


[Eric]
Ah… thanks.


…


You did great too.


What was that about not feeling ready earlier?




[Hannah]
Thanks, hehe. It must have been the adrenaline that got me moving so fast.


Are you heading out now?


[Eric]
Yeah, I’m gonna catch the next streetcar home. I need to pack and get ready.


How about you?


[Hannah]
I’m taking the transport with everyone else who’s housed in the garrison, so I need to stay here. 


I don’t want to keep you. You know I’m not local, but even I know the streetcars take forever to come around. 


Make sure to rest! You need your sleep. I’ll see you later!


[Eric]
Y… yeah.


See you later.

[THOUGHT]
She flashes me a smile before she walks back to mingle with all the others.


She’s a real handful, especially for someone like me who can barely handle conversation. 


But… I can tell she’s a sweet person. 


Anyhow, she’s right. The streetcars are never around when you need them. 


[SFX]3


I open the door, and step outside to the world.


I’m a medical technician now. The reality of it all still hasn’t quite set in.


I hope they’d be proud.
